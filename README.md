# python-api-challenge

This week's API challenge is split into two deliverables: WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb.

WeatherPy.ipynb is a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using citipy Python library and OpenWeatherMap API. 500+ cities were generated at random, with a dataframe exported to csv in the output folder. The output folder also contains scatter plots to visualize the data. A gitignore file has been created to mask the OpenWeatherAPI key.

VacationPy.ipynb is a Python script to help plan future vacations based on our "ideal vacation" parameters, and leverages the csv file generated from WeatherPy. The intended output is a list and map of hotels that fit our "ideal" criteria.
